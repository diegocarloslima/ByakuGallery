# ByakuGallery
ByakuGallery is an open source Android library that allows the visualization of large images with gesture capabilities. This lib is based on AOSP [Camera2](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Camera2/).

![Sample Screenshot](https://github.com/diegocarloslima/ByakuGallery/raw/master/sample.png)&nbsp;![Sample Animation](https://github.com/diegocarloslima/ByakuGallery/raw/master/sample_animation.gif)

The name was inspired by the [Byakugan](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Byakugan) from Naruto series :)

## Features
- The image is split in small tiles and only the visible portion is allocated on memory, avoiding `OutOfmemoryError`.
- Full gesture capabilities: Click, LongClick, DoubleTap, Pan, Fling and Pinch Zoom.
- Smooth animations.
- Can easily be placed inside a parent View with scrolling (e.g. `GalleryViewPager`).

## Sample Application
Download the sample app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diegocarloslima.byakugallery.sample).

The sample app project code is also included on this repository.

## Usage
The ByakuGallery was designed to be the simplest possible to use. Also, the two main classes `TileBitmapDrawable` and `TouchImageView` were designed to be independent. That means you can use them separately if you want to :)

Here are the few steps needed to setup:

1. Add the `TouchImageView` to your xml file:

    ```xml
    <com.diegocarloslima.byakugallery.lib.TouchImageView
    android:id="@+id/my_image"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
    ```
2. Them add these lines to your java code (usually on your `Activity.onCreate()` or `Fragment.onCreateView()` method):

    ```java
    TouchImageView myImage = (TouchImageView) findViewById(R.id.my_image);
    InputStream is = getResources.openRawResource(R.raw.image);
    TileBitmapDrawable.attachTileBitmapDrawable(myImage, is, null, null);
    ```
3. And that's all! For a complete implementation, you can take a look at the sample project.
